```python

$python 01.flow-a.py

+ 参照原文优化后（01.flow-b.py）

```python
from time import time 
t = time()

        temp=lista[a] 
        for b in xrange(len2): 
            x=temp+listb[b] 
print "total run time:"
```

```shell

$python 01.flow-b.py 
total run time:
17.1609051228

+ 使用列表解析优化后（01.flow-c.py）

```python
from time import time

len2=len(listb) 
for i in xrange (1000000): 
    x = [a+b for a in lista for b in listb]
print "total run time:"
```

```shell
[wuxiaomeng@WudeMacBook-Pro ~/Desktop/python/01.speedup ]
$python 01.flow-c.py 
total run time:
